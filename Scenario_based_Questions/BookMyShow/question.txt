Develop a BookMyShow application where you have different events like movies, comedy, tours, workshop, etc. 

A user can book the tickets for that event, every event would have a venue and limited number of tickets.

A user can rate the event too. While booking the ticket calculate the total cost and give it to the user.

An event would have a date, slot, rating, tickets, etc.
