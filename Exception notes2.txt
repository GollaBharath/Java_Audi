What is an Exception:
An exception in Java is an object that represents an error or an unexpected event that occurs during program execution (runtime).

When such an event happens, Java creates an object of a particular Exception class, and this object contains:

i. The type of exception

ii. The description (message) of the error

iii. The stack trace (the list of methods that were running at the time)

Then this object is “thrown” to the Java Runtime System.

How Exceptions Happen:
The Following steps, when an exception occurs:

Step 1: Error Detected at Runtime
When the JVM executes your program, it continuously monitors for abnormal conditions (errors).

Example:
int x = 10 / 0;

When JVM tries to divide 10 by 0, it detects an illegal arithmetic operation.

Step 2: JVM Creates an Exception Object

At that moment, the JVM creates an object representing the error.
This object belongs to a subclass of the Throwable class.

For the above example:

ArithmeticException ex = new ArithmeticException("/ by zero");

Step 3: The Exception is Thrown

The exception object is thrown to the JVM using the throw mechanism — automatically by JVM or manually by programmer.

a)If JVM throws it automatically then it is built-in exception.
b)If programmer throws it manually then it is user-defined or manually thrown exception or custom exception.

Step 4: JVM Looks for a Matching catch Block

Now, the JVM starts searching for a matching catch block that can handle this exception.

It looks in this order:
The current method (try-catch inside method).
If not found → the method that called this method
Continues going up the call stack.

If no method handles it → JVM terminates the program

This process is called Exception Propagation.

Step 5: Control Transfers to the Catch Block

If a matching catch block is found, control is immediately transferred there, and the rest of the code in the try block is skipped.

Example:

try {
    int x = 10 / 0;  // Exception occurs here
    System.out.println("This will not execute");
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
    System.out.println("Exception caught: " + e);
}
System.out.println("Program continues...");


Output:

Exception caught: java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero
Program continues...

Step 6: If No Catch Block Found

If no matching catch block is found in the entire call chain:

JVM prints the exception name, description, and stack trace.

Program terminates abnormally.

Example:

int a = 10 / 0;
System.out.println("Unreachable code");

Output:

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero
	at MyProgram.main(MyProgram.java:3)

Exception Propagation Example
class Test {
    static void divide() {
        int x = 10 / 0;  // exception occurs
    }

    static void compute() {
        divide(); // called by compute()
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            compute(); // exception propagated here
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.out.println("Handled in main(): " + e);
        }
    }
}


Explanation:

Exception occurs in divide().

No catch block → sent to compute().

No catch block there → sent to main().

main() has a catch block → handled.

Output:

Handled in main(): java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero

Types of Exception Generation:
i. Built-in: occurs when When Java code violates rules, Throws It by JVM, eg:Division by zero, invalid index
ii.User-defined Exception:occurs when When programmer defines own error condition,Throws It by Programmer,eg:Age < 18, invalid marks, etc.

Exception Lifecycle 
Error detected → Exception object created → Exception thrown
        ↓
    JVM searches for handler
        ↓
  If found → catch block executes
  If not found → program terminates
