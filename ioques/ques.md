### What is the difference between error throwable and exception?

- Error is a unexpected behavior in the code which occurs when the code has something that leads to things that are not allowed. These errors are a superset which can encompass stuff like exceptions.

- Throwable is a parent class of exceptions and this throwables can be caught with catch blocks. These are usually automatically generated by the JVM. These are usually meant to throw errors.

- Exceptions are errors which are thrown by JVM, but these are often targeted to specific cases, helping us to point out exactly what is wrong in the error.

### Examples of error and exception.

- Error Example :

```java
public class OutOfMemoryExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            // Trying to allocate a huge array
            int[] arr = new int[Integer.MAX_VALUE];
        } catch (OutOfMemoryError e) {
            System.out.println("Caught: " + e);
        }
    }
}
```

- Exception Example :

```java
public class ClassNotFoundExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            Class.forName("com.unknown.Class");
        } catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {
            System.out.println("Caught: " + e);
        }
    }
}
```

### Why use try and catch?

- Try catch blocks are used to handle the exceptions thrown in the code. The code in the try block executes, then if a exception is thrown, then it stops executing that blocks and looks for a catch block. If it does not find one in the whole stack, then the program terminates.

### Why a programmer needs to implement try and catch?

- Try block will act as a cushion for our code, so if it fails, it can fall back to a catch block where it can be handled instead of crashing or running unsafely.

### What will happen if he does not do it?

- If we do not implement try-catch, then any minor cases where the code comes across unexpected behavior or error, it will crash immediately.

### What is a bug in a program?

- When the program strays away from the expected behavior and acts in ways which we did not intend it to, then we call it a bug.

### Can a try have multiple catch? Can a catch have multiple try?

- Yes, a try can have multiple catch and a catch can have multiple try.

### Can I implement try and catch and still the program can stop due to exception?

- Yes, if you don't handle a specific exception that occurred in a try block with appropriate catch block, then that alone is enough to crash the program, regardless of how many other blocks you have in place.

### Can a catch have try and catch? Give example.

- Yes, if we have multiple deeply nested try catch blocks, then the catch block can have multiple try and catch blocks. Example :

```java
try {
    try {
        try {
            // Code that might throw a RuntimeException
            int result = divide(10, 0);
        } catch (RuntimeException e) {
            // Handle the RuntimeException
            System.out.println("Caught RuntimeException: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    } catch (Exception e) {
        // Handle any other type of exception
        System.out.println("Caught Exception: " + e.getMessage());
    }
} catch (Error e) {
    // Handle any uncaught errors
    System.out.println("Caught Error: " + e.getMessage());
}
```

### What are the different types of exceptions?

- Different types of exceptions may include :

  1. FileNotFoundException
  2. ClassNotFoundExceptions
  3. ArithmeticException
  4. NullPointerException

### Major difference between checked and unchecked? Difference between syntax error at compile time and checked exception.

- Checked Exceptions are the exceptions caused when the JVM is compiling the code. Unchecked Exceptions occur at the time of runtime. These errors are difficult to track and are most likely to crash our code.

- Syntax errors occur at compile time and they are checked exceptions. This is because they are easy to track and avoid to make sure our code runs properly.

### Why is checked exception even there?

- Checked errors catch most of the small errors like syntax errors, file not found errors, etc.. which can easily be taken care of and found. This helps make our code more reliable.

### What is e? who creates it? Where does it come from?

```java
catch(Exception e) {}
```

- `e` is a object of the class Exception. JVM is the one that creates it. It comes from when there is a exception in a try block which is present down the stack.
